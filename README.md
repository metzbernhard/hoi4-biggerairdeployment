Bigger Airplane Deployment (Extreme) 

Since people liked my production menu enhancement I moved to the next window that is too small in my oppinion, the air deployment menu. Stretched the menu, ditched the icons and moved a little stuff around so you can see a lot of Airwings at once. Needs a resolution of at least 1080 height. 

If you want the standard slots and just a longer menu, look here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=756708394
